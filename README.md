# KCLagSwitch

A basic lag switch MelonLoader mod for *Kingdom: Classic* (v1.2.0 (R290)), which manipulates Unity's builtin
`Application.targetFrameRate` to simulate lag. Low frame rates can cause various bugs related to large delta
time values in update functions.

**Important**: This mod may not work as intended on platforms other than Windows.
